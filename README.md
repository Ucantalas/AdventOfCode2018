# AdventOfCode2018
Repository for my solutions to Advent Of Code 2018 puzzles.

Each puzzle has its own folder, named after the day and puzzle number. For example, the first puzzle of the first day is named "day_01_01". The first number is the day, the second number is the puzzle number.

Each folder contains a Puzzle file with the full text of the puzzle being solved. They also contain a file holding all the input data, and a file with the script I used to solve the puzzle.
